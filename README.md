# trip-planner-api

Project: a Trip Planner app REST API
The JavaScript Full-Stack Bootcamp
Flavio Copes

In this project we’ll create a REST API using Node.js and Express.

This API will expose a set of GET and POST endpoints to allow getting data out, and sending data in.

We’ll use a MongoDB database to store this data.

Our task is to create a trip cost calculator app.

Imagine going on a trip, and you have your app (which can be a progressive web app, or a mobile app for example) where you add any expense you make. Gasoline, hotels, food, tickets and so on.

When the trip ends, you archive it and it becomes part of the history - which you can navigate and see how much you spent in the past trips.

We’re not going to create the frontend of the application here, just the API.
